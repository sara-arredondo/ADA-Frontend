        <p>I'm sitting by my window watching the lights down the road</br>
            I always do that when the day fades away and night comes on</br>
            Somehow I got to realize this strange feeling;</br>
            a different atmosphere I don't know</br>
            As if this night wouldn't be like all the others</br>
            I feel so tense</br>
            It's worth the expectation of things to come</br>
            What's going on</br>
            Footsteps are calling me</br></p>
        <p>Invitation</p>
        <p>It's this strange song that makes me listen attentively</br>
            Soft vibrations caress my skin and I fear the reaction of my body</br>
            What happens outside?</br></p>
        <p>Invitation</p>
        <p>Through the window I get a view that almost stops my heart</br>
            The night is more than dark</br>
            But this Arabian queen is waving at me</br>
            I feel it</br>
            She's covered by a wrap down to her feet</br>
            Those eyes arise and catching mine</br>
            A lash of passion I cannot explain</br>
            She's talking to me and her lips are turned to stone</br>
            What has she got to say? I cannot understand</br></p>
